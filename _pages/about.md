<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Lingxiao Wang(王凌霄). My research interest includes Machine Learning in Physics (especially high energy nuclear physics, e.g., Nuclear Matter, Lattice QCD, etc.), Medical AI and Human Behavior.

See my latest <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFt4x3EYlrv9-_7SWEHKwdshggN2yv-A/view?usp=sharing'>CV</a> here.

I have organized many "machind learning physics" seminars for physicists online, which are in our <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/lingxiao/mlp-club'>MLP club</a>.


<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
